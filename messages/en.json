        "paragraph1": "I build at the intersection of identity, code, and imagination, where every component is a signal in the constant exchange between human and machine. My work is modular, reactive, and wired with intent like circuits pulsing through a living interface.",
        "paragraph2": "I design systems that feel alive. Every pixel has a reason to exist. Every animation is a conversation. Whether it’s React, Tailwind, shaders, or state machines, my tools shape responsive, immersive experiences that feel as much as they function.",
        "paragraph3": "This isn’t just a portfolio. It’s a grid. A reflection of how I think, create, and connect. A space where creativity flows like data and interfaces hum with energy.",
